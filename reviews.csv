It works well across my Android phone and my browser on my Macbook. I use it for tracking personal and work actions. I find the grocery list really useful. Easy to use and has most grocery items in its database so its very easy to populate. Had an issue with it closing lists by itself. Reached out to Any.do for support and they replied very quickly with the solution which required data clearance and reinstallation. Was worried about loss of data but the reinstall went very smoothly and all data came back from the Any.do server. Great service. Thanks Tali,5,30,5.2.0.23,2020-08-12 08:05:32,,,newest,com.anydo

Todoist is merely okay. I'm vacillating between 2 and 3 stars, because the most common thing I need to do (ALWAYS add a task TO THE TOP of a list) is apparently not possible.

Adding a task at the bottom of the list means the new thing is lost from view and I have to manually rearrange the list. On the web app, you can control where to add a new item by using Shift+A, but there is no preference to ALWAYS do this! There is also no way to do ""Shift+A"" (that I've found) on the Android app. You have to create a task, then manually move it to the top.

I would take a premium version if on the Windows version it would possible to set/change/manage location reminders. For this feature I already wait some years. I'm really surprised that the programmers are not able to add this feature also at the windows app. It's annoying so anoying that you have to edid every task in Android again to add a location reminder..... But it seems to be to difficult for the programmers...??? So when this is to difficult what can we expect? Will the maintanance of the Windows app stay on a reliable basis??? Waiting already since years for a change. Didn't know why the ask me to change settings on Android to change place reminders on my Windows TickTick...

I avoided yours for a long time but still nothing exists yet for adults. I hate RPG (cause I'm not an anti-social loser) but want to gamify my productivity with public leaderboards in an app. Thanks. Looks well made but I don't want it.,1,0,,2019-08-28 14:20:43,"Hi Kelly, thank you so much for leaving us this thoughtful review.

The purchase of Forest made in either iOS or Android is not transferable as Apple and Google sell the apps in their own market. As app developers, we are not in charge of the app-selling process.
You'd need to buy the iOS and Android versions separately, but you'll be able to use the same account on multiple devices on that platform.

The purchase of Forest made in either iOS or Android is not transferable as Apple and Google sell the apps in their own market. As app developers, we are not in charge of the app-selling process.
You'd need to buy the iOS and Android versions separately, but you'll be able to use the same account on multiple devices on that platform.

The purchase of Forest made in either iOS or Android is not transferable as Apple and Google sell the apps in their own market. As app developers, we are not in charge of the app-selling process.
You'd need to buy the iOS and Android versions separately, but you'll be able to use the same account on multiple devices on that platform.

I think that if you introduce a pause button iit wil be very helpful to do our work precisely and there should also be a function that if we do our work for this much hours then we are allowed to take a break of only this much minutes.TY♥️,4,0,,2020-08-14 10:08:48,,,newest,cc.forestapp

Like say if you have multiple diet goals for no dairy, no gluten, and no sugar, it would be great to group those in the diet category and then see your success there overall and trending graphs.

This could be the best habit tracker, goal setter and task manager, with some really great features like nested lists and smart/auto grouping and a very versatile repeat task setup. Just don't confuse the 'game' in RPG for any actual gameplay; but it does have a very elaborate character design and advancement system, that deserves recognition, allowing for a well rounded and unique hero which grows with every task performed in the user's daily life. However Do It Now does hamstring itself by overlooking some very important integral functionality. Firstly there is no way to order the tasks set out in any of the groups. After a solid month of use, building some projects with subtasks which had subtasks, and setting up several habit based routines, the lack of prioritisation or task ordering created a confusing clutter of items which looked no different from the next. While auto-grouping and smart grouping should have been able to help sort that out the lack of ability for the user to remove any task from these groups meant every task appeared, once again losing the important ones in the clutter. User defined groups could only contain the items specifically placed in them- but once again a large project with a number of different aspects can not be ordered into a sensible linear series.. With no social aspect currently attached to the app (as at ver 2.23.0) there is no task sharing. There is also no designated pc/mac/linux front end for desktop syncing. Finally it's expensive as apps go. A one off of $75 will get the full version, or about $2.50 a month (paid yearly), which removes ads and gives calendar access. Original review: ""A good way to make the tedium of self regulation a bit more fun. Being able to plan to skip things when away from regular activities is handy. It would be nice to see characteristic and skill based modifiers affect related task improvements as they raise and subtask attached leader.""",3,32,2.23.0,2020-03-28 18:18:40,Thanks for your review and suggestions!,2020-03-19 02:00:08,newest,com.levor.liferpgtasks

However, there are some problems that make MS To Do awkward to use. 1. You can share lists and assign tasks. This would work a million times better if I could select multiple tasks and assign them to someone, instead of tapping through 3 different views for each task, one by one, and if I could assign someone while I'm adding a new task. Web version is also missing ""assign to"" in the context menu. 2. When setting reminders, it's really not that convenient to click through a ""shortcut"" menu, when I can never use the times listed in the ""shortcuts"". Not everyone's day begins at 09:00 local time. Can you just let me always skip directly to the date & time picker on both due dates and reminders, so that I don't have to second guess every tap? 3. It's cool that we can have themed lists, but the feature is next to useless when I can't set a default theme for all lists at once. I have 20 lists, not counting the weird default ""Tasks"" list. I'm not gonna go through every single one of them every time I want to change my list background or something.",3,67,2.21.162,2020-07-15 14:50:38,,,newest,com.microsoft.todos

The one drawback for me is that it doesn't integrate with Google Tasks or Reminders. This means that everything you want to see needs to be created as an event. This is not a massive deal but I do like the convenience of tasks over events.

UPDATE after 3 years: this app is still unique and so useful that I can no longer do without it on my phone. __ And I just figured out how to add Exchange Work accounts: when adding account in Android settings, do not use the Work account button, but the Gmail button labelled with Exchange. The calendars will then appear on Sectograph like regular Gmail calendars! __ SUGGESTION: My feedback on alarms. I like having a marker for the alarm, but I think this should only apply to clock alarms, not to calendar notifications. These, in my opinion, are intrusive rather than useful. I just want to see when the appointment and not the notification is due. Thank you!",5,1,5.16,2020-07-25 04:58:16,"🙂👍

Oppo devices are very aggressive and have too many settings to prevent apps from doing work in the background. They add different settings to different models too. If you already checked our troubleshooting page we strongly recommend to check the official Oppo forums.

RESPONSE TO STEVEN NOTTAGE'S RESPONSE: That is fair enough, except for one important detail: all the people using your free app are now forced to decide - if they want to have a meaningful app - to pay or search for another app. Premium app should only add features and not restrict free app's capabilities. If you add worthwhile features with a fair pricing, people will buy it. Lots of people spent time to set up their tasking system because the app had the right properties for them, now it looks like they were lured into using the app and then forcing them to pay. I payed for a number of apps (all cheaper than yours btw.), and actually my plan was to pay/donate as soon as the slowness of switching between task lists disappear, because I thought the app is really useful and it deserves support. This change is different. I do not mean you should not ask for payment for cloud backup etc., just that you should not remove the free local backup (or any other feature). Or that you should have omitted it from the free version from the start. Best wishes! RESPONSE TO STEVEN NOTTAGE'S SECOND RESPONSE: Actually you can clearly see from my review that I do not want everything for free. My problem is different. If we could not understand each other so far, perhaps it's not worth trying any more. So I won't comment on the rest of your answer. All the best!",3,1,2.2.0,2020-03-13 21:36:09,"Sándor, I understand you just want everything for free & don't want to show my little app any support.

The only reason for not doing that is that I've been using your app for some time, before the new ad behavior, and it was fine. 2. Let's ignore my previous point for a minute and consider this: a ""Business Calendar"" app that sends me adds about online games that I can ""skip"" by stopping the app and then re-opening... Really, if I'm a business person what would I want with an online game for children? 3. You mentioned the apps has to be deployed daily. Tough luck! I did not make your release schedule, you did. Furthermore I would be perfectly fine using an older version of the app, with no ads, or far fewer adds. I really don't care about the latest releases, and most business people don't either. We want stable things that we don't need to upgrade every week or so. 4. Since the ads covering the whole screen started being pushed I realized that your app has little added value over the calendar apps that came preinstalled on my mobile devices... And they don't have any adds.",1,0,2.32.2,2020-06-26 20:47:00,"Hi, we avoided this solution for as long as it was possible.
